# Switcheo Backend Internship Problem 4 - Jun Han Huang

## Overview

    In this problem I wanted to demonstrate some key golang / programming concepts.

    Method 1 utilizes recursion to sum from 0 to n.

    Method 2 demonstrates the concurrency capabilities of golang (though it is overkill for this task)

    Method 3 is the most straightforward and intuitive way of summing 0 to n.

## Instructions

    Make sure that golang is installed on your machine.

    Execute code by running
    ```
    go run problem4.go
    ```
